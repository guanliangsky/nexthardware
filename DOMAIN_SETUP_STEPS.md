# Step-by-Step Domain Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Domain Information
**What we need from you:**
- Your domain name (e.g., `nexthardware.io`)
- Access to your Porkbun account

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
We'll deploy your site first to get a hosting URL.

## Step 3: Connect Domain to Vercel
We'll add your domain in Vercel dashboard.

## Step 4: Configure DNS in Porkbun
We'll add the DNS records Vercel provides.

## Step 5: Wait for DNS Propagation
Usually takes 5-10 minutes, sometimes up to 24 hours.

## Step 6: SSL Certificate
Vercel automatically provides SSL (HTTPS) - takes a few minutes.
